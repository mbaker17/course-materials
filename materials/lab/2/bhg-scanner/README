1. Explain what the code does.
The code scans for ports and stores and outputs if they are open or closed.

2. Modification to the code based on Todo
TODO 1 - Just a comment that explains how to run the code.
TODO 2 - 
TODO 3 - Track closed ports.
TODO 4 - Tunes the program by changing the amount of threads running in the program.
TODO 5 - Add closed ports output. Also add a comma for parsing later on.
TODO 6 - Return total number of ports scanned. Closed + Open.

3. Modification of the code 
I added the ability to specify how many ports you want scanned.
