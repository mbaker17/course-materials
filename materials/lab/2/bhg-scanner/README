1. Explain what the code does.

Function Worker
Operates on a range of ports. Uses a communication channel. For all ports create address with port number. Create connection for one second and then move on. If there is an error send -port number to the channel. Else close connection and send the port number to the channel.

Function PortScanner
Sets size of channel. Create parallel processes with workers. Take one port out of the channel at a time. If port > 0 append to open port list. If port < 0 then change to positive number and append to closed port list. Then print out open and closed ports. Finally return the total number of ports scanned.

2. Modification to the code based on Todos
TODO 1 - Just a comment that explains how to run the code.
TODO 2 - Change to a dial time out which is shorter than the default 
TODO 3 - Track closed ports.
TODO 4 - Tunes the program by changing the size of the channel.
TODO 5 - Add closed ports output. Also add a comma for parsing later on.
TODO 6 - Return total number of ports scanned. Closed + Open.

3. Modification of the code 
I added the ability to specify how many ports you want scanned.
